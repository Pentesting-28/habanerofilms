                <p>Habanero films is a production company with more than 15 years of experience producing content. They have produced over 500 programs for television, several documentaries, short films and feature films throughout Mexico and Latin America. They take a cinematographic approach to all of their projects including their advertising and branded content jobs, always looking for the story in the projects they take on.</p>

                <p>Habanero has produced documentaries that not only have won prestigious awards but have obtained international distribution, notably <i>XV in Zaachila</i> National Geographic worldwide, <i>Tula Espejo del Cielo</i> Canal 22-TVE, <i>Conquistadors</i> PBS-BBC, <i>Mariachi the Spirit of Mexico</i> PBS-BBC <i>Tango the Spirit of Argentina, Fiesta Mexicana, Entre el Cielo y el Concreto</i> and <i>Dosis Personal</i> TV UNAM, among others. Just released is the documentary <i>Voces de Guerrero</i> about the disappearance of the 43 students in the state of Guerrero, Mexico.</p>

                <p>Habanero also produced one of the first Mexican science fiction features titled <i>Depositarios</i>, a ground breaking production that won two Ariel awards (Mexico’s equivalent to the Oscars). That same year Habanero was also nominated for the Ariel for best short feature with <i>Los Trashumantes</i>. In 2016, with the animation short film <i>“The Insekt,”</i> Habanero won best experimental short film in Cannes and best animation short film in several other festivals. They are currently in postproduction with the project titled <i>How to make your first XXX film</i>, a movie that has already secured Latin American distribution.</p>

                <p>Recently they teamed up with the Hyundai Motor Company and INAH (the National Institute of Anthropology and History) to develop “Explore Teotihuacan” an application created to enhance the experience of the more than 4 million sightseers who visit the Teotihuacan archaeological site every year. The app’s content includes an audio guide, a series of breath-taking videos shot in 4 K with multiple cameras for several days and nights using motion control, drone work and a series of 360s of a 3D model of what the site would have looked like 2,000 years ago.</p>
